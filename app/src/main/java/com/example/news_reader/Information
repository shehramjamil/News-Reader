1. Qualifiers is another way of annotation which can be used when we have two dependency functions here of same return type
2. observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  // This is added becuase the recycler view have to update the UI and main thread
   is used to do the UI related stuff like updating the recyclerview otherwise list will be shown on touch
3. // Below code is for regular observers
   /*viewModel.fetchNews
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  // to do the UI related stuff otherwise list will be shown on touch
                .subscribe(observer())*/
